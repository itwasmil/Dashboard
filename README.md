# Project Title: P7 Dashboard with Streamlit

## Project Overview

This project was completed as part of the OpenClassrooms Data Scientist program (Project #7).

### Credit Scoring Model Implementation

The financial company " Prêt à dépenser" specializes in offering consumer loans to individuals with limited or no credit history. The primary goal of this project is to implement a credit scoring model. The company aims to develop an algorithm that calculates the probability of a customer repaying their loan and classifies loan applications as either approved or denied. The algorithm leverages diverse data sources, including behavioral data and information from other financial institutions.

### Analysis and Modeling

The complete analysis and modeling process are documented in Jupyter Notebooks, available in the "Notebook" folder of this repository.

### Data Source

The original dataset used for this project can be downloaded from Kaggle [here](https://www.kaggle.com/c/home-credit-default-risk/data).

## Interactive Dashboard with Streamlit

In response to client demands for transparency in credit approval decisions, the project includes the development of an interactive dashboard using Streamlit. This dashboard serves the dual purpose of enabling relationship managers to transparently explain credit decisions and providing customers easy access to and exploration of their personal information.

### Dashboard Specifications

The Streamlit dashboard encompasses the following key features:

1. **User-Friendly Filtering System:**
   - Visualizes descriptive information tailored to a specific client through an intuitive filtering system.

2. **Interpretative Score Visualization:**
   - Presents the score and its interpretation for each client in a manner easily digestible for individuals without an extensive background in data science.

3. **Comparative Descriptive and Score Visualization:**
   - Facilitates seamless comparison by visually presenting descriptive information and scores for another client.

4. **Feature Importance Visualization:**
   - Highlights the most influential features in the decision-making process, elucidating their positive or negative impact on predictions.

5. **Client-Specific Feature Comparison:**
   - Allows a detailed comparison of the chosen client's data for a specific feature against the entire client base.

These features collectively enhance the dashboard's usability, providing comprehensive insights into individual client profiles and the decision-making dynamics of the credit scoring model.
